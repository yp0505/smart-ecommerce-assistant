## üß† What This Chatbot Can Do

### üîπ Product Intelligence
Ask questions like:
- "What are the top-rated guitar strings?"
- "Which products are best for beginners?"

It will use a vector store to fetch relevant items, build a custom prompt, and ask the LLM to answer like a shopping expert.

### üîπ Order Summaries
Ask:
- "What did I order last year?"
- "Show me my recent car accessories orders"

It extracts and formats structured order data, and passes it to the LLM to explain like a human agent.

### üîπ Multi-turn Conversations
Supports:
- Remembering intent across messages
- Awaiting Customer ID in follow-ups
- Responding naturally with OLLaMA-generated sentences

---

## üìö Datasets Used

- **Product_Information_Dataset.csv**: 5,000+ musical product listings
- **Order_Data_Dataset.csv**: Customer purchase data including sales, dates, shipping

Used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation prompts and memory.
